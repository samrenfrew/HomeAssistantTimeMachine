# Home Assistant Time Machine

Home Assistant Time Machine is a web-based tool that acts as a "Time Machine" for your Home Assistant configuration. Browse YAML backups across automations, scripts, Lovelace dashboards, ESPHome files, and packages, then restore individual items back to your live setup with confidence.

## What's New!

*   **Backup Lock, Deletion & Export:** Added a new backup lock feature to prevent accidental deletion of snapshots. You can now also manually delete or export individual backups as .tar.gz archives directly from the web UI using the new right-click context menu.
*   **HACS Integration:** Now available as a companion integration via HACS! Track backup status with a native sensor and trigger backups using the `time_machine.backup_now` service.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Navigate backups and items using arrow keys! Use Up/Down to change selection and Left/Right to switch between panels. Press Enter on an item to view its diff.
*   **Manifest-Driven Backups & Restoration:** Every backup now includes a detailed file manifest, ensuring that restores and change detection are perfectly aware of where your files live and are automatically placed back exactly where they belong in your YAML structure.
*   **Docker Env Var:** Added `ESPHOME_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable support for Docker installations, allowing custom locations for ESPHome configuration files.
*   **Split Config Support:** Optimized for advanced Home Assistant setups using `!include`, `!include_dir_list`, and other split configuration methods.

## Installation

There are two ways to install Home Assistant Time Machine: as a Home Assistant add-on or as a standalone Docker container.

### 1. Home Assistant add-on (Recommended for most users)

1.  **Add Repository:**
    Click the button below to add the repository to your Home Assistant instance:

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add-on store](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/saihgupr/ha-addons)

    **Or manually add it:**
    - Navigate to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **Add-on Store**
    - Click the three dots (⋮) in the top right corner and select **Repositories**
    - Add the repository URL:
      ```
      https://github.com/saihgupr/ha-addons
      ```

2.  **Install the Add-on:**
    The "Home Assistant Time Machine" add-on will now appear in the store. Click on it and then click "Install".

<details>
<summary><h3>2. Standalone Docker Installation</h3></summary>

For Docker users who aren't using the Home Assistant add-on, you have three deployment options:

**Option A: Docker Compose (recommended):**

1. Download the compose.yaml file:
   ```bash
   curl -o compose.yaml https://github.com/saihgupr/HomeAssistantTimeMachine/raw/branch/main/compose.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the file to set your paths and credentials:
   ```bash
   nano compose.yaml
   ```

3. Start the service:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

**Option B: Docker Run (pre-built image):**

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 54000:54000 \
  -e HOME_ASSISTANT_URL="http://your-ha-instance:8123" \
  -e LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-long-lived-access-token" \
  -e ESPHOME_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/esphome/config" \
  -e THEME="dark" \
  -e DEBUG_LOGS="false" \
  -v /path/to/your/ha/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/your/backups:/media \
  -v ha-time-machine-data:/data \
  --name ha-time-machine \
  ghcr.io/saihgupr/homeassistanttimemachine:latest
```

**Option C: Build locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saihgupr/HomeAssistantTimeMachine.git
cd HomeAssistantTimeMachine/homeassistant-time-machine
docker build -t ha-time-machine .

docker run -d \
  -p 54000:54000 \
  -e HOME_ASSISTANT_URL="http://your-ha-instance:8123" \
  -e LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-long-lived-access-token" \
  -e ESPHOME_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/esphome/config" \
  -e THEME="dark" \
  -e DEBUG_LOGS="false" \
  -v /path/to/your/ha/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/your/backups:/media \
  -v ha-time-machine-data:/data \
  --name ha-time-machine \
  ha-time-machine
```

Supplying the URL and token keeps credentials out of the UI. These environment variables are optional—if you set them, the settings fields are read-only; if you omit them, you can enter credentials in the web UI instead.

**Alternative:** omit the environment variables, start the container with the same volumes, then visit `http://localhost:54000` to enter credentials in the settings modal. They are stored in `/data/docker-ha-credentials.json`.

#### Changing Options in Docker

After the container is running, you can toggle ESPHome support, adjust text style, and switch light/dark modes by POSTing to the app settings API. This persists the value in `/data/homeassistant-time-machine/docker-app-settings.json` so the UI reflects it on reload:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:54000/api/app-settings \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "theme": "light",
        "esphomeEnabled": true,
        "packagesEnabled": true,
        "language": "de"
      }'
```

Adjust the payload if you need different paths, theme, or want to enable/disable features (`"esphomeEnabled": true|false`, `"packagesEnabled": true|false`, `"theme": light|dark`, `"language": en|es|de|fr|nl|it`).

#### Accessing the Web Interface

After starting the container, access the web interface at `http://localhost:54000` (or your server's IP/port).

> [!NOTE]
> The HA URL and token fields in settings will be read-only if configured via environment variables, or editable if configured through the web UI.

<details>
<summary><h3>HACS Companion Integration</h3></summary>

Enhance your Home Assistant experience by adding the Time Machine companion integration via HACS. This provides:
- **Sensors:** Track backup status and health directly in Home Assistant.
- **Services:** Trigger backups using native `time_machine.backup_now` service calls in your automations.

#### Installation & Setup:

<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=saihgupr&repository=HomeAssistantTimeMachine&category=integration">
  <img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store." />
</a>

**Or manually add the custom repository:**

1. Ensure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. In Home Assistant, go to **HACS** → **Integrations**.
3. Click the three dots (⋮) in the top right and select **Custom repositories**.
4. Add `https://github.com/saihgupr/HomeAssistantTimeMachine` as an **Integration**.
5. Find **Home Assistant Time Machine** in HACS and click **Download**.
6. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**.
7. Click **Add Integration** in the bottom right and search for **Home Assistant Time Machine**.
8. Follow the UI prompts.
   * If installed via the official Home Assistant Add-on, it will automatically discover the instance!
   * If installed via Docker (or if auto-discovery fails), you will be prompted to enter the instance URL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Docker Users:** Use the internal container name (e.g., `http://ha-time-machine:54000`) if they share a network, or your server's LAN IP if they are on separate hosts. 
> - **Note:** If `sensor.time_machine_status` shows as `Offline`, it usually means Home Assistant cannot reach the Time Machine API at that address.

#### Sensor: `sensor.time_machine_status`
Monitor your backup system health directly in Home Assistant.

| Attribute | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `state` | Current status of the instance | `Online` |

| `backup_count` | Total number of backups stored | `764` |
| `last_backup` | Timestamp of the last backup | `2026-02-17-000000` |
| `disk_total_gb` | Total storage space | `111.73` |
| `disk_free_gb` | Available storage space | `13.68` |
| `disk_used_pct` | Storage usage percentage | `87.8%` |
| `last_backup_status` | Status of the most recent run | `success` |

#### Action: `time_machine.backup_now`
Trigger backups via service calls in your automations or scripts.

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `url` | (Optional) The URL of your Time Machine instance. Uses the integration's configured URL if left blank. | `http://192.168.1.4:54000` |
| `smart_backup_enabled` | Only backup if changes are detected compared to the last snapshot. | `true` |
| `max_backups_enabled` | Whether to enforce the maximum number of backups to keep. | `true` |
| `max_backups_count` | The number of backups to keep before removing oldest ones. | `100` |
| `live_config_path` | The source path in the container to backup (default is `/config`). | `/config` |
| `backup_folder_path` | The destination path in the container for backups (default is `/media/timemachine`). | `/media/timemachine` |
| `timezone` | The timezone to use for the backup folder name (e.g., `America/New_York`). | `America/New_York` |

**Example Automation:**
```yaml
action: time_machine.backup_now
data:
  smart_backup_enabled: true
  max_backups_enabled: true
  max_backups_count: 100
  timezone: "America/New_York"
```

</details>

## Usage

> [!TIP]
> If you expose port `54000/tcp` (for example, via the add-on's Configuration tab), you can open the UI directly at `http://your-host:54000` without relying on ingress.

### Home Assistant add-on

1.  **Configure the add-on:** In the add-on's configuration tab, set theme, language, esphome/packages toggle, and port.
2.  **Start the add-on.**
3.  **Open the Web UI:**
    *   Use **Open Web UI** from the add-on panel to launch ingress (default recommended when the external port is disabled).
    *   Or, if you've enabled port `54000/tcp` in the add-on configuration, browse to `http://homeassistant.local:54000` (or your configured host/port).
4.  **In-app setup:**
    *   In the web UI, go to the settings menu.
    *   **Live Home Assistant Folder Path:** Set the path to your Home Assistant configuration directory (e.g., `/config`).
    *   **Backup Folder Path:** Set the path to the directory where your backups are stored (e.g., `/media/timemachine`).

### Docker Container

1.  **Start the container** with the required volume mounts (see Docker installation above).
2.  **Open the Web UI** at `http://localhost:54000` (or your server's IP/port).
3.  **In-app setup:**
    *   In the web UI, go to the settings menu.
    *   **Live Home Assistant Folder Path:** Set to `/config` (this is the mounted volume).
    *   **Backup Folder Path:** Set to `/media/timemachine` (this is the mounted volume).

### Triggering Backups from Automations

**Basic Method (Add-on built-in):**
You can trigger a backup from Home Assistant automations or scripts using the `hassio.addon_stdin` service:

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
  addon: 0f6ec05b_homeassistant-time-machine
  input: backup
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `0f6ec05b_homeassistant-time-machine` with your addon's slug if different.

For more control over your backups (like setting a custom timezone, limiting max backups, or only backing up when changes occur), install the [HACS Companion Integration](#hacs-companion-integration) and use the `time_machine.backup_now` service instead.

## Backup to Remote Share

To configure backups to a remote share, first set up network storage within Home Assistant (Settings > System > Storage > 'Add network storage'). Name the share 'backups' and set its usage to 'Media'. Once configured, you can then specify the backup path in Home Assistant Time Machine settings as '/media/backups', which will direct backups to your remote share.
